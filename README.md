rust version
============

It is unrealistic to maintain a canonical version. However, updates required to maintain nightly compatibility are typically trivial.
Realizing it is broken (I don't update very day) is the hardest part. Feel free to open a PR/Issue.

This incompatibility is _typically_ gated by `serde-rs/aster` as `rust-nightly` gets released.
